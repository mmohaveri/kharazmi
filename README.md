# Kharazmi

Kharazmi, persian pronunciation of Khwarizmi (al-Khwarizmi, Algorithmi), is an equation parser/calculator module for python.

## Installation

Simply install using pip:

```bash
pip install kharazmi
```

Keep in mind that Kharazmi uses [Python type annotations (PEP 484)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/), and
[f-Strings (PEP 498)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/) so you'll need Python 3.6 or higher.
